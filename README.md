### Happy coding ðŸ‘‹

Hi,

I am a CTO in the Conversational AI space. I've launched a successful AI startup once, and I'm doing it again, this time with more support from clients and investors because they see the value much easier in 2023 than in 2020 or 2021.

I run a mentorship group for coding on the side called SolveStack.

Best,
//Ana
